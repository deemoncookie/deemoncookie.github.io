						<p>even though we don't yet have a label and I'm not sure whether this is the proper time. I really want to say</p>
						<p>those three letters, "ily," because you have shown me so much care and love that I haven't felt for so many </p>
						<p>years. It's genuine for me, but let's hold off on saying the word because you and I are not a couple yet.</center> </p>
